# Cave Bar Menu

## Description

A handy menu commissioned for a home bar. Guests aren't expected to be very familiar with craft cocktails, so this menu allows them to find interesting drinks at a glance, or take a bit more time and filter by the type of flavor profile, or spirit they want to sample next. Additionally, the bartender can use this tool as a quick recipe reference when necessary.

## Next Steps

- Add some more functionality: some guests have requested a way to make a small queue of drinks to try at the beginning of the night.
